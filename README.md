# Samuel_Mouradian_proj2


## Programing Assignment II for Computer Science 219


### How To Run The Code
    __Step 1__: The file for this assignment is named "Samuel_Mouradian_proj2", and its contents are written in the c++ language. The easiest way is to open a codespace on GitHub, and dragging the files into the codespace for testing. You can also drag the file into Visual Studio Code on your system.

    __Step 2__: After dragging the files into the workspace, there will be specific tools/extensions you will need to install in order to run the executable. In the extensions tab on the left side of the screen, install the following:
        1. Microsoft's "C/C++" packs
        2. Microsoft's "Makefile Tools" pack
        3. danielpinto8zz6's "C/C++ Compile Run" pack
    The codespace should open a pop-up window asking you if you would like to install these things should you not have them already.

    __Step 3__: Once everything is in order, open the terminal window at the bottom of the codespace screen. You can do this by hovering over the "problems" and "warnings" icon in the bottom left of the status bar, then selecting "Terminal".

    __Step 4__: After opening up the terminal, simply type "make". The files should compile, and an executable named "PP1" should be generated.

    __Step 5__: Type the command "./PA2F" into the terminal, and select enter, this should run the executable.

    __Step 6__: After you are done with the executable, type "make clean" into the terminal to remove the "driver.o" file, as well as the executable.

    __Step 7__: Exit the codespace.
